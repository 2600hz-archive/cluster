    <h1 class="center">Welcome to the VoIP Cluster Manager!</h1>
    <div>This tool is designed to help you deploy and manage one or more clusters of VoIP servers.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>When we say "deploy", we're referring to the automatic installation, configuration and clustering of:<br/>
        <ul style="margin-left:30px">
            <li>VoIP Switching Software (like FreeSWITCH)</li>
            <li>Session Border Controllers / Load Balancers (like OpenSIPs)</li>
            <li>Individual Session Control Tools (like eCallMgr)</li>
            <li>Dialplan and User Authentication Systems (like Whistle's Registrar App)</li>
            <li>Database Software (like BigCouch)</li>
            <li>Best-Practice Firewall Settings (IPTables, fail2ban)</li>
            <li>Monitoring Tools</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    
    <div>On the next screen you'll be able to add your first server or set of servers. You'll be asked to make a decision. You can:
        <ul style="margin-left:30px">
            <li>Deploy a single server with all components (useful for testing) with no ability to expand</li>
            <li>Deploy a full suite of production servers (with the ability to expand the cluster later as you need)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>&nbsp;</div>

    <div style="width:800px">
        Whichever option you choose, you'll gain access to the full suite of services documented at http://wiki.2600hz.org/
        including our completely API driven PBX and VoIP call handling services.

        <b>WARNING:</b><br/>
        The deployment requires your servers to be setup with CentOS 5.5 or 5.6. You must also properly match the hostname
        configured on the server with the hostname you enter in this tool (even if DNS isn't setup). Finally, the system clock
        must be accurate on the server you are deploying.
    </div>

    <div style="width:800px">
        <b>NOTE:</b><br/>
        You don't need your own cluster to take advantage of 2600hz's services or take things for a test spin. Your account is
        already configured to use our demo server. When you're ready to move to production, we can host your service or you can.
